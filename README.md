# HAC Ada Compiler User Manual

## Introduction

HAC is a recursive acronym meaning **HAC Ada Compiler**. HAC isnâ€™t a native code compiler but a Virtual Machine compiler which comes with a very compact and monolithic run-time executor.

HAC can be used for **small Ada sand-boxed prototypes, education and scripting**.

As an **education tool**, HAC is an excellent Ada subset for programming introduction.

As a **script language**, thanks for its **shebang handling** and its useful environment functions, HAC is the **most Ada compact and powerful script engine you ever dream for**. The HAC compilation is straightforward. The executor is **ridiculously small and fully standalone**. Move the hac program to your path and voila!

Last but not the least, **HAC sources are fully compatible with Ada compilers**, through the compatibility package HAT !
